    "We have learned a bit about how to program in Python and some ways in which we can make our code more Pythonic.  However, programming is not only about making the computer do work for us, its about optimizing the amount of work the computer needs to do.  There are multiple types of work we can consider, but here we will consider three major bottlenecks in code:\n",

    "An *Algorithm* is a procedure for solving a problem.  It describes a sequence of operations then when performed will result in a solution to a problem.  There are many types of algorithms, some are guaranteed find a solution, some do not. Often we are interested in understanding the performance of an algorithm in terms of the three bottlenecks listed above (as well as others).  In order to analyze these algorithms, we need to develop some tools to understand how algorithms behave as a function of the problem size.\n",

    "In order to quantify the complexity of a particular algorithm, we can consider how the algorithm grows with respect to the size of the problem.  For the purposes of this notebook we will only consider problems that are one dimensional, so we can quantify the algorithm with respect to a single number, which we will denote as $N$.  Remember that a problem itself does not have a complexity, rather it is the algorithmic solution which has complexity.  For example, lets consider the problem of summing all the numbers between 1 and $N$ (inclusive).  On way to sum this might be to take the of all of these numbers."

    "This does better on average, but it still has the same $O(N)$ runtime.  Such optimizations are useful, but we can do better.  Lets implement what is sometimes known as binary search.  This is a recursive algorithm that allows the list to be divided roughly in half on each recursive step.  this will yield logarithmic asymptotic run time.  Lets first illustrate the algorithm by walking through an example where `l_=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]` and we want to check if 2 is contained in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we check the midpoint of the list, which is 6.  We know that 2 does not equal 6, but since the list is sorted, we can immediately rule out the part of the list containing numbers greater than 6.  Thus we have already ruled out half the elements of the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can ask the question is 2 contained in list `[1,2,3,4,5]`.  First we check the midpoint element of the list, which is 3.  We know that 3 is not 2, but again, since $3>2$, we can eliminate half the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can check if 2 is contained in the list `[1,2]`.  We will take midpoint of this list as the first element (since it has index $1=len(list)/2$), and this is equal to 2.  Thus 2 is in the original list.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see we have performed this search in only three steps and up to an extra step, this did not depend on where 2 was in the list, only that it was sorted.  Since we are removing half the list each time, we expect that the number of steps will be roughly $log(N)$, where the logarithm is understood to be base 2.  Lets make a plot of this function compared to $N$."

For example, if we don't already have sorted data, we probably don't want to use binary search because we would need to sort the data first and then would negate any search improvement (sorting is worse than $O(N)$).  \n",

    "\n",
    "Other data structures lend themselves to other algorithmic purposes..  For example, a `heap` (implemented in Python with the [`heapq`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html) library) implements a tree like structure which is useful for order statistics, such as keeping track of the largest or smallest $N$ items in a collection.  You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap).\n",
